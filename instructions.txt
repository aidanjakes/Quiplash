The game can be found at: "https://quiplash-coursework-333603.nw.r.appspot.com/" or equally run locally
Players can log in or register, if more than 8 players have joined or a game is in progress then the player will be added to the audience.
The first user to log in/register will be the admin, they act as any other player but only they can decide to advance the game.
The game consists of 3 rounds.
Each round consists of:
	-entering prompts (if not enough prompts are added then prompts will be randomly drawn from azure database)
	-each player (non audience) will then receive 1 or 2 prompts depending on if number of players is even or odd
	-each player (including audience) will vote for what they feel is the best answer
	-the number of votes each prompt received will then be shown
	-this process of voting and displaying prompt results is repeated until there are no more prompts for this round,
		in which case show the round results
	-the players scores will then be shown at the end of the round
A player receives 100*roundnumber score for each vote
Once all 3 rounds have been played a game leaderboard will be displayed
Once all 3 games have been played the admin will have the option to end the game, this will log out all users and 
	everyone will be taken to the sign in page
NOTES:
If the admin leaves then the admin should be reallocated to another player
If possible, half the prompts will be user submitted and half from the azure database but if not then the numbers of prompts required 
will be randomly selected from the database.
If a user is already logged in they should not be able to log in again
